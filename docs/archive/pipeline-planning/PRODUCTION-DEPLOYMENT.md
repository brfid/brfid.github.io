- **Retired model:** `ArpanetProductionStack` (2x t3.micro + EFS)
- **Current model:** single-host `edcloud`

## Use instead

Current lifecycle and operational docs:

- `https://github.com/brfid/edcloud/blob/main/README.md`
- `https://github.com/brfid/edcloud/blob/main/SETUP.md`
- `https://github.com/brfid/edcloud/blob/main/DESIGN.md`

## Historical scope of this file
