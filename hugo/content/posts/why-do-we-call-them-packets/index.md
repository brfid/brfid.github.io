Donald Davies introduced _packet_ into computer networking in the 1960s. He recalled
choosing the word after consulting Steve Whelan, a linguist on their machine translation
project, "at least partly because of its ease of translation." That's the standard story.

But the trail goes further back.

At the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Davies worked alongside Alan Turing. Turing
used _packet_ to describe a discrete data structure in
[Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://doi.org/10.2307/2251299)
(_Mind_ 59/236, 1950):

He wrote that paper before leaving NPL in 1948. So the word was already in local
circulation when Davies reached for it. He may have chosen from the vocabulary already
present rather than coined it fresh.

Where did NPL get it? One plausible path: the _wave packet_ from physics. Early digital
computers used delay-line memory, developed in the mid-1940s. Researchers writing about
these systems used _packet_ to describe discrete phenomena in the lines:

And again in Sidney Greenwald's 1953 _Proceedings of the IRE_ paper on the SEAC:

Turing joined NPL in 1945 to design the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), which used
delay-line memory. His [1946 ACE design report](https://archive.org/details/amturingsacerepo00turi)
doesn't use the word _packet_, but I haven't gone through all the ACE materials, so it
may appear elsewhere.

The most likely path: _packet_ entered computing through delay-line physics, was already
in use at NPL before Davies coined it for networking, and Davies simply inherited it —
consciously or not.
