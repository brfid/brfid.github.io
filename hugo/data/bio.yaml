label: "Principal Technical Writer — API documentation, platform engineering, AI workflows"
summary: "I own documentation platforms and build the tooling that powers them — CI/CD
  pipelines, OpenAPI workflows, and production LLM integrations including MCP servers
  for deterministic quality control. Currently at DomainTools, where I run
  docs.domaintools.com end to end for a B2B security intelligence company with 800+
  customers, bringing documentation into the SDLC so it ships with products at launch.
