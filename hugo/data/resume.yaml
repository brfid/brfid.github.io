  summary: I own documentation platforms and build the tooling that powers them —
    CI/CD pipelines, OpenAPI workflows, and production LLM integrations including
    MCP servers for deterministic quality control. Currently at DomainTools, where
    I run docs.domaintools.com end to end for a B2B security intelligence company
    with 800+ customers, bringing documentation into the SDLC so it ships with products
    at launch. Published researcher with credits at USENIX Security and IEEE; authored
    a commissioned history of the internet co-foreworded by Vint Cerf for Google and ICANN.

  summary: Own docs.domaintools.com and all supporting tooling for a 150-person B2B
    security intelligence company serving 800+ customers. Moved documentation into
    the SDLC — critical updates ship same-day, and products launch with docs at tech preview.
  highlights:
  - Migrated 120+ documents into a unified MkDocs-Material platform with CI/CD,
    Swagger UI, and SME contribution workflows spanning 4 engineering teams.
  - Authored OpenAPI specifications across 4 API product lines; specs drive production
    code generation, Swagger UI rendering, and contract validation.
  - Reduced documentation cycle time from weeks (ticket-driven, manual) to same-day
    for critical updates; docs now ship with products at tech preview through SDLC integration.
  - Built Python/Jinja2/LaTeX PDF generator with theming and dynamic TOC for branded
    customer-facing documentation.
  - Built production MCP server with anti-hallucination controls integrating Vale,
    markdownlint, spaCy, and custom linters to guide LLMs through deterministic documentation
    quality fixes.
