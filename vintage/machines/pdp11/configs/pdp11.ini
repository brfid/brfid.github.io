; PDP-11/73 with 2.11BSD Configuration
; Pre-built disk image provides turnkey boot
;
; Option B (uuencode console transfer) notes:
;   - Networking (xq) is not needed.  The netnix kernel crashes on xq init;
;     only the plain unix kernel is used (booted by default with Enter at ':').
;   - Tape (ts) is not needed; artifact transfer is via console injection.
;   - Container does not run with --privileged so pcap/xq would fail anyway.

; CPU configuration - PDP-11/73 with 4MB memory
set cpu 11/73 4M
set cpu idle

; Console on telnet port 2327 for interactive access
set console telnet=2327

; Disk controller - RP06 with pre-built 2.11BSD image
set rp0 enable
set rp0 RP06
attach rp0 211bsd_rpeth.dsk

; Disable unused devices
set xq disabled
set rl disable
set hk disable
set rk disable
set tm disable
set ts disable

; Boot from disk (unix kernel is default; press Enter at 'Boot:' prompt)
boot rp0
