; SIMH H316 IMP Configuration - IMP #1
; This simulates an Interface Message Processor (IMP) from the original ARPANET
;
; The IMP was based on Honeywell 316/516 minicomputers running BBN-developed
; firmware for packet switching.

; Configure the H316 CPU
set cpu 16k
set cpu idle

; Console configuration
set console telnet=2323

; Paper tape reader (for loading IMP firmware)
set ptr enabled
set ptp enabled

; Disk configuration (for IMP state)
set dp enabled
set dp0 enabled

; Network interfaces for IMP
; Line 0: Connection to Host (VAX at 172.20.0.10:2000)
; Additional lines can be configured for IMP-to-IMP links

; Note: The actual IMP firmware and detailed network configuration
; will be added after exploring the obsolescence/arpanet repository
; which contains the authentic IMP software and configuration.

; For now, this is a placeholder. Once the arpanet repo is fully cloned,
; we'll integrate the actual IMP binary and network setup.

; Set realistic timing
set throttle 1m

; Attach firmware when available
; attach ptr imp_firmware.bin
; boot ptr

; For testing, we'll just idle the simulator
; Once IMP firmware is available, replace this with proper boot sequence
echo IMP #1 initialized (waiting for firmware)
echo Connect via telnet to port 2323
