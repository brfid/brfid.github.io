  summary: I set documentation strategy, own the platforms, and build the tooling —
    CI/CD pipelines, OpenAPI workflows, and production LLM integrations including
    MCP servers for deterministic quality control. At DomainTools I authored the
    company's documentation strategy and roadmap and built docs.domaintools.com
    end to end for a B2B security intelligence company with 800+ customers, bringing
    documentation into the SDLC so products launch with docs at tech preview. Published
    researcher with USENIX Security and IEEE credits; co-authored a commissioned history
    of the internet foreworded by Vint Cerf for Google and ICANN — a research background
    that means I document complex systems at depth and interview senior technical
    stakeholders with authority.

  startDate: '2023-10-01'
  summary: Own docs.domaintools.com and all supporting tooling for a 150-person B2B
    security intelligence company serving 800+ customers. Moved documentation into
    the SDLC — critical updates ship same-day, and products launch with docs at tech preview.
  highlights:
  - Authored the company's documentation strategy and roadmap from scratch —
    no coordinated documentation system existed before this role — defining platform
    architecture, tooling selection, SDLC integration model, SME contribution
    workflows, and quality standards.
  - Migrated 120+ documents into a unified MkDocs-Material platform with CI/CD,
    Swagger UI, and SME contribution workflows spanning 4 engineering teams.
  - Authored OpenAPI specifications across 4 API product lines; specs drive production
    code generation, Swagger UI rendering, and contract validation.
  - Reduced documentation cycle time from weeks (ticket-driven, manual) to same-day
    for critical updates; docs now ship with products at tech preview through SDLC integration.
  - Built Python/Jinja2/LaTeX PDF generator with theming and dynamic TOC for branded
    customer-facing documentation.
  - Built a production MCP server that addresses the core reliability problem in
    LLM-assisted documentation — non-deterministic quality outputs — by integrating
    Vale, markdownlint, spaCy, and custom linters as callable tools, giving LLMs
    an auditable, repeatable path through documentation quality fixes.
